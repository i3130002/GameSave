# GameSave
This is a public repository for everyone to share and access to others game save data.


#How to use it:

#How does it work ?
By uploading your save data to its folder and adding some description at the name of the sub folder, your commit, sub Readme.md people can reach your game save data and use it.(cause you might have something special that someone really wants or some one may lost his saves and wanted to use users cause you have the same achievements)

By downloading save data and putting it to your hard disk (specific location for each game) you can play using that save data.


#why we made it ?
As me and my friend played "the forest" using some kind of crack over Lan and we may play it later, but we also may force to reinstall the operation system, we decided to upload our saves over here and make platform for others to do so or better use each others save.
